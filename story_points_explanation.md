# What Are Story Points?

Imagine you're planning a trip with friends, and you're trying to figure out how much effort each part of the trip will take. Instead of saying, "This will take 2 hours" or "This will take 5 hours," you say, "This task feels easy," or "This feels more complicated and tiring."

Story points are kind of like that. In the world of software development, when teams work on different tasks (like building a feature for an app), they don’t estimate exact hours because things can get tricky or unpredictable. Instead, they use **story points** to say how difficult or how much effort the task will require. It’s a way to guess how much work something will take without worrying about being exact.

## Why Not Just Use Time Estimates?

Imagine you're baking a cake for the first time. If someone asked you how long it will take, you might say, "Maybe 2 hours," but that’s just a guess. You might run into problems—like realizing halfway through that you don’t have all the ingredients or that the oven isn’t working right. Suddenly, your "2 hours" turns into 3 or 4 hours.

It’s the same with software development. Sometimes, it’s hard to predict how long something will take because unexpected challenges pop up. Story points help teams **estimate effort**, without the pressure of having to predict exact time.

## How Do Story Points Work?

Story points are like a **scale** of difficulty. Let’s say your team is using numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 (this is common). Here’s what those numbers might mean:

- **1 point**: Super easy. Like sending an email or making a simple change.
- **3 points**: A bit more effort, but still manageable. Maybe like cooking a meal you’ve made many times before.
- **5 points**: Starting to get more complex. Think of it like trying a new recipe or planning a day trip to a place you've never been.
- **8 points**: Hard! Lots of unknowns, like planning a whole vacation to a new country with different language and customs.

## How Does a Team Decide the Points?

When a team looks at a task, they ask themselves a few questions:

1. **How hard will it be?** 
   - Is this something we’ve done before, or is it new and tricky?
   
2. **How many steps are involved?**
   - Does it have many parts, or is it straightforward?

3. **Are there any surprises that might come up?**
   - Could something unexpected make this harder?

The team then agrees on how many points they think the task deserves based on those questions. It’s all about understanding how much **effort** the task will take compared to other tasks they’ve done.

## Example in Real Life

Let’s imagine you’re helping to organize a party. Here are two tasks:

- **Task 1**: Sending out the invitations.
  - It’s something you’ve done before, and it doesn’t take much time. You already have all the email addresses.
  - **Story points**: 1 (super easy, no surprises).

- **Task 2**: Planning the food for 50 people with different dietary needs.
  - You’ll need to research menus, talk to caterers, and make sure there’s something for everyone. You also don’t know everyone’s preferences yet.
  - **Story points**: 8 (lots of complexity and uncertainty).

In this example, sending the invitations is a simple task, so it gets fewer points, while planning the food is much more complicated and gets more points.

## How Do Story Points Help Teams?

1. **Better Planning**: Teams know how much effort they can handle in a set period of time. By tracking story points, they can figure out how many tasks to take on at once without getting overwhelmed.
   
2. **Focus on Effort, Not Time**: Instead of guessing exact hours or days, story points let teams think about how hard something will be, which makes planning more realistic.

3. **Improvement Over Time**: As teams work more together and use story points, they get better at estimating effort. It helps them improve their accuracy when planning future tasks.

## What Happens After Assigning Story Points?

Once story points are assigned to tasks, the team can decide how many tasks they can take on in a **Sprint** (a short time period where the team works to complete tasks). For example, if the team knows they can handle around **30 story points** in one Sprint, they’ll pick tasks from their to-do list that add up to around 30 points.

## Story Points Aren’t Perfect (But That’s Okay)

- **Different Opinions**: Sometimes, people on the team might disagree on how difficult a task is, but that’s okay! It leads to discussions, and the team can agree on a final number together.
- **Not About Exactness**: Story points aren’t an exact science—they’re just a helpful way for teams to compare tasks and plan their work better.

## Summary in Simple Terms

Story points are like a **difficulty rating** for tasks. They don’t measure time, but instead measure how hard or complex something feels. It’s like planning a trip: you don’t always know how long each part will take, but you can estimate how tough each part will be. By using story points, teams can plan smarter and improve over time.
